# BrainWave Chat Application

Welcome to BrainWave, a secure and user-friendly chat application. This project emphasizes key aspects like security, user interface, and modularity. Below are the key features and considerations taken into account during development:

## Key Features

### Security

- **Password Hashing**: For enhanced security, I've used `crypto` instead of `bcrypt.js` to hash passwords. `Crypto` provides a higher level of security compared to `bcrypt.js`.

### User Interface

- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices.
- **Dark Mode**: With a preference for dark mode among users, the application's color theme is dark, providing a visually comfortable experience.

### Real-Time Communication

- **Socket.io Integration**: The application uses `socket.io` to facilitate real-time communication, allowing users to send and receive messages instantly.

## Development Approach

### Database Schema

- Designing the database schema was a bit challenging, but I successfully managed to create a robust and efficient structure.

### Project Structure

- The project is developed with a focus on modularity and maintainability, ensuring a clean and organized codebase.

## Demonstration

A link to a demo of the application will be provided below. I invite you to explore and test the application.
